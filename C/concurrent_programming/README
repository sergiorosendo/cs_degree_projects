About the program:
	The program features a race track in which cyclists compete, each cyclist 
is a thread (a subtask of the main program). Every cyclist should move between
each time frame. So each thread has to be executed once, and only once, before
the main thread advances another time step. To accomplish such synchronization,
semaphores (variables that control when a thread may be executed) are used.
