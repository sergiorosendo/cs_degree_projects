# symbol_table

A C program that produces a list of the words encountered inside a file (in UTF-8 format) alongside their number of occurrences.

The program can be run using one of five different data-structures, which are:

    - unsorted vector
    - sorted vector
    - unsorted linked list
    - sorted linked list
    - binary search tree

Personal goal: train the implementation of the aforementioned structures and study their differences in performance and memory usage.
