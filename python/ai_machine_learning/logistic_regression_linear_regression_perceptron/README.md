# AI_Logistic_Regression_Linear_Regression_Perceptron
An introduction to the AI algorithms Logistic Regression, Linear Regression and Perceptron. In this program these algoritms are used to identify the number contained in images. The images, from the MNIST dataset, have 28x28 pixels and contain the drawings of different numbers, ranging from 0 to 9.

# Jupyter Notebook
The code is written with python jupyter notebook. As described in https://jupyter.org/, this type of document contains live code, equations, visualizations ad narrative text, which allows for a better and faster understanding of the software.

# About the plotted results
Among other plots, the notebook contains the cofusion matrices for each algorithm's results. These provide a clear understanding of their effieciency.
