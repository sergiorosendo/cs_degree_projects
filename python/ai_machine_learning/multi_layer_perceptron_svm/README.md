# AI_Multi_Layer_Perceptron_Support_Vector_Machine
An introduction to the AI algorithms Multi Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine. The algorithms used are the ones provided in scikit-learn, a machine-learning library for python. In this program these algoritms are used to identify the number contained in images. The images, from the MNIST dataset, have 28x28 pixels and contain the drawings of different numbers, ranging from 0 to 9.

# Scikit-Learn
This notebook uses the scikit-learn library. As described in https://scikit-learn.org/stable/, it provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, it is open source and commercially usable. 

# Jupyter Notebook
The code is written with python jupyter notebook. As described in https://jupyter.org/, this type of document contains live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text, which allows for easier and better understanding of the machine learning process.

# About the plotted results
Among other plots, the notebook contains the cofusion matrices for each of the algorithm's results. They provide a clear understanding of each method's effieciency and allow us to compare and decide which learning algorithm is better suited for our case.
