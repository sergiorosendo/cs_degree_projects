# AI_minimax_expectimax
An introduction to AI algorithms that use minimax and expectimax decision rules. These rules are applied in order to choose the best action available, aiming to minimize the loss for a worst case scenario.

An introduction to AI algorithms that apply the concept of minimax and expectimax in decision making. 
The goal with these concepts is to minimize the loss in worst case scenarios.

This exercise is provided by UC Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu.) Most of the code was already written from the get go.

My task was to implement the minimax and expectimax decision rules. These are implemented in the file 'multiAgents.py'.
