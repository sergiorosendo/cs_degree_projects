# AI_reinforcement_learning
An introduction to AI algorithms that apply the concept of reinforcement learning, specifically the value iteration and the Q-learning algorithms. 

This exercise is provided by UC Berkeley (http://ai.berkeley.edu.)
Most of the code was already written from the get go. 

My task was to implement the value iteration and Q-learning algorithms. These are implemented in files 'valueIteration.py' and 'qlearningAgents.py'.

This decision maker features a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A MDP provides a mathemathical framework that allows the AI to define a policy. 
The policy is a map that shows the best action on each environment state and it allows the agent to take optimal actions even if something went wrong along the way. 
MDP is very suited for situations where the outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of the decision maker.
